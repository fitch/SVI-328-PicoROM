Redistribution of the PCB board schematics or the Kicad project (files in the pcb directory) is not permitted without a written permission from the author.

If you want to use the PCB in commercial purposes, you're not allowed to do that without a written permission from the author. As an exception, making a small batch of boards, using some of the boards for personal projects and selling the remaining boards is permitted.
